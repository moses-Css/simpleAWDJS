# Vercel Deployment Fix - TODO

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. **Fixed server.js with robust error handling**
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around device detection
- Added fallback values for the `device` variable
- Improved User-Agent header validation
- Added error logging for debugging
- Made the code more serverless-friendly

### 2. **Enhanced detectDevice function**
- Added null/undefined input validation
- Added error handling for regex operations
- Ensured function always returns a valid device type
- Added fallback to "desktop" on any error

### 3. **Added Vercel configuration**
- Created `vercel.json` with proper Node.js runtime settings
- Configured routing for serverless environment
- Set production environment variables

## üîÑ Next Steps

### 1. **Test the fix locally**
```bash
npm start
# or
node server.js
```
- Verify the application works without errors
- Test with different User-Agent strings
- Check that device detection works properly

### 2. **Deploy to Vercel**
```bash
vercel --prod
```
- Deploy the updated code to Vercel
- Monitor the deployment logs
- Check if the internal server error is resolved

### 3. **Verify the fix**
- Test the deployed application on Vercel
- Check browser console for any remaining errors
- Verify device detection works across different devices
- Test the cookie override functionality

### 4. **Monitor and debug**
- Check Vercel function logs for any remaining issues
- Monitor error rates in production
- Consider adding more detailed logging if needed

## üìù Key Changes Made

1. **Error Prevention**: The `device` variable is now guaranteed to be defined before template rendering
2. **Fallback Strategy**: If device detection fails, the app defaults to "desktop" instead of crashing
3. **Better Logging**: Added detailed error logging to help identify issues in production
4. **Serverless Optimization**: Made the code more compatible with Vercel's serverless environment

## üöÄ Expected Results

- ‚úÖ No more "ReferenceError: device is not defined" errors
- ‚úÖ Application works consistently on both localhost and Vercel
- ‚úÖ Proper fallback behavior when device detection fails
- ‚úÖ Better error visibility through logging

The fix should resolve the internal server error you were experiencing on Vercel deployment.
